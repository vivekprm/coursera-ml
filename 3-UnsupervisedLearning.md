In this category we are given a dataset and our purpose is to find a structure (cluster), unlike in supervised learning where we were given cancer type 
malignant & benign.

One example where clustering is used is google news. Google news crawls and groups cohesive sub stories.

# Clustering
Take a collection of 1,000,000 different genes, and find a way to automatically group these genes into groups that are somehow similar or related by different 
variables, such as lifespan, location, roles, and so on.

# Non-clustering
The "Cocktail Party Algorithm", allows you to find structure in a chaotic environment. (i.e. identifying individual voices and music from a mesh of sounds at 
a [cocktail party](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cocktail_party_effect)).
